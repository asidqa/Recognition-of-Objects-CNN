# Recognition-of-Objects-CNN
Object detection using a deep learning algorithm. helps in classifying ten classes of the cifar dataset.  The algorithm used was Convolutional Neural Networks famously known as CNN.

## CIFAR DATASET
It is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images
Each image is an RGB image of size 32x32.<br/>
